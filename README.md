# normalize-1.1.2.js
Normalizes the JavaScript browser environment for the 10% of browsers that aren't modern.

Brings older browsers up closer to modern javascript standards by normalizing the cross-browser implementation (and polyfilling it, if it isn't there), of every single prototype
and prototype method in the Javascript language.
